x112acab - a daemon that can record x11 output in the basic format used
for ACAB (all colors are beautiful) in Puerto Giesing.

start the daemon x112acab, then echo the XID to record in hex to the
daemon's fifo /tmp/x112acab.fifo

I did patch my xscreensaver but it's actually not required.
--debug prints out the required xwindow-id. do sth like:

xscreensaver-demo --debug 2>&1 | sed -nu 's/^.*XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW=\(0x[a-fA-F0-9]*\)/\1/p' > /tmp/x112acab.fifo
